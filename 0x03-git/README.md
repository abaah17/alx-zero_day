Basic Git comprehension


The folder is collection of basic Git commands structured like exercises. The 
collection encourages to enhance your git skills on the comand line. These are the 
basic commands. i.e 

$ git clone <repo>
$ touch test
$ git add test
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
$ git push origin master

This file is mandatory in all ALX School projects. I am enjoying every bit of content provided here. I love it and I hope you will find the repo exciting.
